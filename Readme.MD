**Technologies Used**
- PHP 8.0+ - Server-side programming language

- Twig 3.x - Modern templating engine

- Symfony HttpFoundation - HTTP request/response handling

- JSON File Storage - Data persistence

- PHP Sessions - User authentication

- Pure CSS - Styling (identical to React/Vue versions)


# Features

**Core Functionality**
- Landing Page - Hero section with wave SVG background and decorative circles

- Authentication - Login and signup with form validation

- Dashboard - Statistics overview and navigation

- Ticket Management - Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- Responsive Design - Mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts

`Security & Validation`
- Session-based authentication

- Form validation with error messages

- Protected routes for authenticated pages

- Input sanitization and validation

# User Experience
- Real-time form validation

- Success/error feedback messages

- Modal forms for ticket creation/editing

- Confirmation dialogs for deletions

- Consistent navigation across all pages

# Development
- Adding New Routes
- Add route to src/Router.php

- Create controller method in appropriate controller

- Create corresponding Twig template

`Template Inheritance`
- All templates extend layouts/base.twig which provides:

- Global CSS styles

- HTML structure

- Consistent layout

**Data Storage**
Users are stored in data/users.json

Tickets are stored in data/tickets.json

Files are automatically created if they don't exist

## Known Issues & Limitations
Data Storage: JSON files are not suitable for production environments

Security: No CSRF protection implemented

Performance: No caching mechanism for templates

File Permissions: May require manual permission setup on some servers

Scalability: Not designed for high-traffic applications

`` Framework Comparison``
This implementation provides the same functionality as the React and Vue.js versions:

Identical user interface and experience

Same feature set and user flows

Consistent design language

Matching responsive behavior

# Support
For issues related to this specific implementation:
